# My first blog article

### Look at code highlighting and math support here

```latex
x = \frac{1}{2}
```

You can even inline math $$\frac{1}{2}$$ isn't it great?

And write a small Rust program:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!('Hello world!');
}
```

Or even in TypeScript:

```typescript
function main() {
    console.log('Hello world!');
}
```
